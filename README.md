British Airways SQL Analysis

Project Overview
British Airways aims to improve customer satisfaction and perceived value for money by analysing passenger review data. This project uses SQL to uncover insights segmented by route, traveller type, aircraft, and region, helping identify areas for service and operational improvements.

Key Business Questions

* How can British Airways enhance customer satisfaction and value for money based on passenger reviews?
* Which routes, aircraft, and traveller types show the highest or lowest satisfaction?
* Are there geographic trends in passenger satisfaction that British Airways should address?

Key Insights

* Top-rated route: London to Malaga scored highest in satisfaction (6/6), but this was based on a single review, suggesting a need for more data to validate.
* Low perceived value: Across all traveller types (Couple, Business, Solo), the average value-for-money rating was 0, indicating widespread dissatisfaction or price misalignment.
* Aircraft impact: The Airbus A350 had the highest average satisfaction rating (4), while older Boeing models and large aircraft such as the A380 had lower scores (1–2), possibly due to cabin experience issues.
* Regional trends: Reviews from Germany showed slightly higher satisfaction (average 2.5) compared to the UK, US, Australia, and Iceland (average 1–2).
* Traveller type distribution: Couples contributed the majority of reviews (10), followed by Business travellers (5) and Solo travellers (2).

Business Recommendations

* Focus on collecting more data to better understand satisfaction on routes with limited feedback.
* Review pricing and value propositions to address the low perceived value across traveller types.
* Investigate cabin experience improvements, especially on older Boeing models and large aircraft.
* Target regional service improvements based on satisfaction disparities.

 Tools & Technologies
